# TRP-2020
Trying to update an old game jam game, The Right Perspective.

## Planned changes so far:
- **Improved Interface.** Clearer buttons, better controls, more feedback. May remove ability to select any level at any time.
- **Better tutorialization.** Rather than requiring the player to read the controls, showing them ingame as necessary.
- **Improved clarity.** Connections between buttons and fans, a lock symbol on locked goals, etc.
- **More Juice!** Some animation bounce, improved feedback on actions, more moving parts (visually).
- **Cursors/Indicators.** Tiles you can go to will be highlit and have feedback when you choose a tile you can or can not reach.
- **Code refactor.** Updating old code to use techniques I have since learned about, and replacing hardcoded animation with actual animators.
- **Level Transitions.** Simple animations from level to level.

## Stretchier goals:
- **Touch support & Android release.**
- **Level editor.** At the very least, text file import of levels.
